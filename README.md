# Solar Power Generation data taken from Kaggle, which contains energy generation as well as weather data from 2 plants during the course of 34 days in India.
# Scope of this project is to try to understand how energy generation fluctuates during the day, and get familiar with efficient prediction techniques
# These plants use photovoltaic cells, in which the photovoltaic effect is employed to generate direct current (DC) power which is then converted into alternating current (AC) power by the inverters
